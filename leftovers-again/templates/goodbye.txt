OK, you're all set! Your core bot files are in the current directory.

Before you begin, install your dependencies:
`npm install`

Your bot's already prepared for battle! First, open a new console and run the server locally:
    git clone https://github.com/dramamine/Pokemon-Showdown.git
    npm run server

Run this command to play against your first opponent:

`npm start -- --opponent=randumb`

Other useful commands:
`npm run develop --opponent=randumb`: watch src folder, and re-run a match
                                      whenever you save changes

`npm start -- --production`: connect to cyberdyne.psim.us

`npm start -- --help`: full list of commands for leftovers-again
